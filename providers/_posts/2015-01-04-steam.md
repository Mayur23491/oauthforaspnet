## 1. Register an app in Steam

In Steam once logged, go to the [api key page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and register the domain field for your application. After you have registered the application, take note of the Key.

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the Steam OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider

Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.Steam` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.Steam;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following lines of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseSteamAuthentication("Your API Key");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the Steam provider will request Steam to redirect to the path `/signin-openidsteam` after the user has signed in and granted permissions on Steam. You can specify an alternative redirect URL:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new SteamAuthenticationOptions
{
    ApplicationKey = "Your API Key",
    CallbackPath = new PathString("/oauth-redirect/steam")
};
app.UseSteamAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

### Retrieve user information returned from Steam

You can retrieve the user information returned from Steam in the `OnAuthenticated` callback function which gets invoked after the user has authenticated:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new SteamAuthenticationOptions
{
    ApplicationKey = "Your API Key",
    Provider = new OpenIDAuthenticationProvider // Steam is based on OpenID
    {
        OnAuthenticated = async context =>
        {
            // Retrieve the user's identity with info like username and steam id in Claims property
            var identity = context.Identity;
        }
    }
};
app.UseSteamAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}
